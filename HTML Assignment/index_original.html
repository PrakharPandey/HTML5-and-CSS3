			<p>During the last 24 hours, many parts of the region recorded rains of varying intensity. Particularly, Kolkata saw some heavy showers to the tune of 46 mm in span of 24 hours from 8:30 am on Wednesday. All thanks to the trough running from Sub-Himalayan West Bengal to Northwest Bay of Bengal across Gangetic West Bengal.</p></td>

			<p>Gujarat as well as Rajasthan did witness one of the worst floods in a long time. Scores were killed in these floods and normal life did come to a standstill for quite some time. So much so that the relief was sent from all across over these areas. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced relief worth 2000 crore for ones affected in Gujarat floods.</p></td>

			<p>Coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh have received moderate showers with one or two heavy spells since last two days. But the weather conditions of interior parts of the state remained almost dry. Anantapur, Kurnool, and Kadapa is witnessing dry weather since many days and will continue to. Presently this weather system has weakened and lies as a feeble trough.</p></td>
